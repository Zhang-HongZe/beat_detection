            Threshold for bass surge detection. The actual value is this number divided by 10.
            For example, 60 means 6.0.
            Range: 10-1000 (1.0 to 100.0)

        help
            Average ratio threshold for beat detection. The actual value is this number divided by 10.
            For example, 50 means 5.0.
            Range: 10-1000 (1.0 to 100.0)

        help
            Minimum energy threshold for beat detection. The actual value is this number divided by 1000.
            For example, 10 means 0.01.
            Range: 1-10000 (0.001 to 10.0)

    config BEAT_DETECTION_TIME_INTERVAL
        int "Time interval between beat detections (ms)"
        range 10 10000

        help
            Minimum time interval in milliseconds between consecutive beat detections.
            Range: 10-10000 ms
